Federal Reserve Economic Data, FRED, is an online database consisting of hundreds of thousands of economic data time series from scores of national, international, public, and private sources. FRED, created and maintained by the Research Department at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, goes far beyond simply providing data: It combines data with a powerful mix of tools that help the user understand, interact with, display, and disseminate the data. FRED has contained many of the more popular figures reported by the Board of Governors, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Census---among others.

The data are accessible from a variety of different hardware and software, with the primary point of access being the FRED website. By directly downloading the record data from the FRED website, they will be pretty useful for the time series analysis of the relationship between the stock market and the economic conditions overall. Specifically, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), unemployment rate, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will be three main indicators from the economic perspective to analyze the changes in trends of the stock market.

Here is the preview of one of the data sets, the unemployment rate, downloaded from FRED that will be used for this project.
